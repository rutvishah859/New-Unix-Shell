## Shell Manual

The commands you can utilize with this shell and their functionalities are listed below.

When you first start the shell, the shell environment will contain `shell=<pathname>/myshell`
where `<pathname>/myshell` is the full path for the shell executable (the one from which it was executed).

### `cd <directory>` - change directory

### Other functionalities that the shell supports are indicated below:

### `stdin` and `stdout` - I/O Redirection
**Description:**
<br />
Stdin is an input stream (standard input) and it accepts text as its input. Stdout is an output stream (standard output) and is used to deliver text output text from the command to the shell. 

*Redirecting Input*: To redirect the input from a file, indicate the command, followed by the `<` redirection symbol, and then the name of the file. 

*Redirecting Output*: To redirect output to a file, indicate the command, followed by the `>` redirection symbol, and then the name of the file. The output file will be created if it does not exist and truncated if it does.
Using the `>>` redirection token will create an output file if it does not exist and append to it if it does.
stdout will be possible for the internal commands `dir`, `environ`, `echo`, and `help`.

*Redirecting Both Input and Output*: To redirect both input and output at the same time, you can use indicate the program name and its arguments that will be executed, followed by the stdin FILE stream, and then the stdout FILE stream.

### ampersand (`&`) - background execution
**Description:**
<br />
An ampersand (`&`) at the end of the command line will cause the shell to return to the command line prompt immediately after launching that program. The shell will execute the command in the background in a subshell and will not wait for the command to finish.

### `myshell <fileName>` - command line input from a file
**Description:**
<br />
The shell will take its command line input from the file specified. The file is assumed to contain a set of command lines for the shell to process. Once the end-of-file is reached, the shell will exit.
